This is something I wanted to tinker with for a long time - a 4d raytracer.

This is a unity project adapted from shader posted on shadertoy, here:

Which is also made by me.

Raycasting is performed by shooting rays into the world through an object that serves as a portal.
The difference is that calculations are performed in 4d space. There are no manual controls in the project,
the movement is hardcoded into the shader, and moves along predefined coordinates.

I initially made it into a Unity project, because I wanted to see how 4d parallax would look in a google cardboard headset.

Unfortunately, the results weren't as good as I expected them to be.

Anyway, it is available under zlib license and you can tinker with it. Have fun.
